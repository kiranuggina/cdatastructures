# Linked List.

Implemented the below:

Creation & Deletion:
  1. unsorted
  2. sorted.
  3. delete
  4. reverse (both iterative and recursive)

-> merge two unsorted linked lists.
-> merge two sorted linked lists. (iterative and recursive)
-> remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
-> remvoe duplicates form a unsorted linked list.
-> middle of the list
-> apply merge sort to the list
-> nth node from the end of the list.
-> palindrome

Todo:

-> count the occurance of a key
-> detect a loop
-> detect and remove a loop
-> reverse a list in group of given size.
-> reverse alternate nodes of a linked list.
-> delete alternate nodes of a linked list.
-> alternating split of a given linked list.
-> identical linked lists
-> swap nodes in a linked list without swapping data.
-> pair wise swap elements
-> pair wise swap elements by changing links.
-> pair wise swap adjacent nodes by chaning pointers.
